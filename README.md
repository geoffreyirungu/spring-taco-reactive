# READ ME
I did this project as part of the spring in action 6th edition book.

The main takeaways of this project center around Reactive Spring:
* Using Spring Webflux(Spring's reactive web framework)
* Writing and testing reactive controllers and clients
* Consuming REST APIs reactively
* Securing reactive web applications
* Reactive relational persistence with R2DBC
* Testing reactive repositories
